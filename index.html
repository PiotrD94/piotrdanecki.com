    Hi! I am Piotr. I have a lovely cat. I call her π π. I am intrested a little in almost everything.
     From cooking through painting to technology, electronics, chemistry and others.
     I am strongly interested in philosophy psychology and futurology. One of my favorite authors in these fields 
     is Stanislaw Lem. 

        I am learning in order to change my current job. 
        I have worked on CLI app I'll show it tommorow.
