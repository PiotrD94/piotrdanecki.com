                        a lovely cat. I call her π π. I am intrested a bit in almost
                        everything.
                        From cooking through painting to technology, electronics, chemistry and others.
                        I am strongly interested in philosophy psychology and futurology. One of my favorite author in
                        these fields
                        is Stanislaw Lem.

                                think there is too many to list all of them here</p>
                        </ul>

                    <h1>My other activities</h1>
                    <p>Beside from reading books I like to cook and paint. Result of these two activities you can see on
                        my instagram page. From time to time I also repair broken phones or to be more precise I am just
                        replacing broken parts, I can solder and usualy I can find the reason why something don't work.
                        I think that creating and fixing things are my hobbies. I also like to watch some youtube
                        channels that filfull my desire for knowledge that I don't even know i have. For example:
                        <ul class="list-non-bullet">
                            <li>Cody's lab</li>
                            <li>Veritasium</li>

                            <li>Steve Mould</li>
                            <li>ElectroBOOM</li>
